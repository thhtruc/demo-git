# Python IDEs
In this training program, we will mainly focus on VS Code as Python IDE, but you could take a look at others such as: PyCharm, Juputer Notebook, vim,...

## Visual Code
### 1. Autocomplete and IntelliSense
Check the docs: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense

### 2. Linting
Linting analyzes your Python code for potential errors, making it easy to navigate to and correct different problems.
The Python extension can apply a number of different linters including Pylint, pycodestyle, Flake8, mypy, pydocstyle, prospector, and pylama
